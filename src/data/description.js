        title: "Plastic Pollution",
        content: "Plastic pollution is a serious threat to our health, economy, and environment that requires rapid attention. Global plastic manufacturing has expanded tremendously in recent decades, reaching a startling 400 million tons per year, with only 9% recycled and 12% burnt. On June 5, 2023, the World Health Organization declared that if we do not act strategically, the influx of plastic debris into our oceans will triple by 2040. These plastic particles in ocean and land undergo various degradation due to sunlight , photo oxidation (UV light), thermal degradation, ozone induced degradation, mechano-chemical degradation such as friction and free radical formation and result in the generation of microplastics (Shaista Manzoor et al, 2022) . The WHO also noted that microplastics have an impact beyond marine life and create enormous economic losses, with yearly marine ecosystem services valued between US$ 500 billion to US$ 2,500 billion being disrupted. Furthermore, the health consequences of plastics, particularly microplastics, are serious. Exposure to microplastic particles raises health risks, and research is ongoing to better understand the associated dangers."

        title: "What are Microplastics?",
        content: "Microplastics are tiny plastic fragments formed by the breakdown of bigger polymers and the industrial development of products. These tiny particles, which are typically less than 5 millimeters, are ubiquitous in the ecosystem and are impacting both wildlife and mankind. They have been identified in aquatic species, drinking water, and several foods notably salt and honey stated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2021). Additionally, microplastics can be inhaled (Ziani et al., 2023).Once absorbed by animals, microplastics can distribute to various organs, including the liver, spleen, heart, lungs, and brain, potentially causing significant health issues, reported the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2008. Microplastics can carry persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, disrupting biological processes and causing endocrine, immune, reproductive, and developmental problems, as well as carcinogenesis (UNEP, 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated microplastic pollution due to the increased use of polypropylene-based face masks and poor waste management (UNEP, 2020). Based on their origin, microplastics can be divided into primary and secondary categories. The primary microplastics are those that are released in their natural forms while secondary microplastics are derived by weathering or breakdown of large plastics (Espinosa et al., 2016). The abundant rise in the use of microplastics, mainly in cosmetics starting from the 1980s has been associated with the extensive presence of microplastics in the environment.",

            "Once plastics (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) enter the marine ecosystem, they persist for hundreds to thousands of years, breaking down through mechanical or photochemical processes into microplastics (particles less than 5mm) or nanoplastics (particles less than 1 µm) (Issac and Balasubramanian, 2021), requiring meticulous research to effectively remove them from the surroundings, as their tiny size and lack of uniformity make it particularly challenging to extract from polluted areas (Leng et al., 2018)."

            "Microplastics cause various harmful effects on both human health and the environment.",
            "Microplastics have been identified across several sequential stages in a food chain starting from lower levels like zooplankton and copepods to higher levels like fish, seabirds and mammals (Cverenkárová et al., 2021). Ingestion of microplastics by these organisms through the food web cascade can cause inflammation, physical blockages, and decreased feeding capacity. Other common sources of microplastics in the food chain include soil poisoning due to irrigation using wastewater, landfills, treatment of soil and usage of sewage sludge as fertilizers. This leads to decreased soil quality, consequently entering the food chain (Czapska et al., 2022). The ingestion of contaminated food or water, inhalation and dermal can be en route sources of microplastics in humans. As they enter the human body, they may tend to cause oxidative stress, deplete energy balance, metabolism and the immune system and can lead to respiratory and gastrointestinal problems (Jenner et al., 2022).",
            "Microplastics are common in both aquatic and earthbound systems. These are found in deep seas, oceans, soil and household systems. The sources of microplastics from households include food containers, fabrics or any other plastic products (Geueke et al., 2018). Studies have found an enormous amount of microplastic contagion in tap and bottled water, tea, wine, beer, soft drinks and various food items that include fish, spices and other products from terrestrial animals (Kosuth et al., 2018)."

            "Nanotechnology has the ability to solve microplastic degradation challenges. Functionalized carbon nanosprings, for example, have demonstrated increased catalytic performance and stability, resulting in a considerable reduction in activation energy for microplastic removal. Photocatalytic systems employing zinc oxide nanorods and zinc-cadmium photocatalysts have also shown effective microplastic breakdown under visible light (Jino, 2024)."

The simplicity of peptide synthesis and resin immobilization allows for easy scalability, making this method ideal for large-scale deployment in diverse water treatment scenarios, balancing sustainability and efficiency.",

By targeting specific types of microplastics such as polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, and polyethylene terephthalate, we ensure efficient capture of these particles. The peptides and associated microplastics are then separated using a resin complex. This method not only enhances the speed and ease of isolation but also reduces sample contamination and minimizes the use of harsh chemicals. Moreover, this innovative approach offers scalability and adaptability, providing a versatile tool for addressing microplastic pollution in various conditions."

Once these His-tagged peptides are produced, the Ni-NTA resin is introduced, forming a resin-peptide complex. This complex is then applied to the contaminated area where microplastics need to be removed, resulting in a resin-peptide-microplastic complex. The resin, along with the bound microplastics, is subsequently removed through filtration or centrifugation, effectively eliminating the microplastics from the system."]
