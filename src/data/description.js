        title: "Plastic Pollution",
        content: "“**Plastic pollution** is a serious threat to our health, economy, and environment that requires rapid attention”. Global plastic manufacturing has expanded tremendously in recent decades, reaching a startling 400 million tons per year, with only 9% recycled and 12% burnt. On June 5, 2023, the World Health Organization declared that if we do not act strategically, the influx of plastic debris into our oceans will triple by 2040. These plastic particles in ocean and land undergo various changes due to sunlight, photo-oxidation (UV light), Thermal degradation, Ozone induced degradation, and Mechano-chemical degradation such as friction and free radical formation that result in the generation of microplastics (Shaista Manzoor et al, 2022). The WHO also reported that microplastics have an impact beyond marine life and create enormous economic losses, with disruption of marine ecosystem services valued between US$ 500 billion to US$ 2,500 billion per year. Furthermore, the health consequences of plastics, particularly microplastics, are serious. Exposure to microplastic particles raises health risks, and research is ongoing to better understand the associated dangers."

        title: "What are Microplastics?",
        content: "Microplastics are tiny plastic fragments formed by the breakdown of bigger polymers and during the industrial development of products. These tiny particles, which are typically less than 5 millimeters, are ubiquitous in the ecosystem and are impacting both wildlife and mankind. They have been identified in aquatic species, drinking water, and several foods notably salt and honey as stated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), 2021. Additionally, microplastics can be inhaled (Ziani et al., 2023). Once absorbed by animals, microplastics can be distributed to various organs, including the liver, spleen, heart, lungs, and brain, potentially causing significant health issues, as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 2008. Microplastics can carry persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, disrupting biological processes, and causing endocrine, immune, reproductive, and developmental problems, as well as cancer (UNEP, 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated microplastic pollution due to the increased use of polypropylene-based face masks and poor waste management (UNEP, 2020). Based on their origin, microplastics can be divided into primary and secondary categories. Primary microplastics are those that are released in their natural forms while secondary microplastics are derived by weathering or breakdown of large plastics (Espinosa et al., 2016). The abundant rise in the use of microplastics, mainly in cosmetics starting from the 1980s has been associated with the extensive presence of microplastics in the environment.",

            "As production ramps up and degradation continues, these tiny particles accumulate, wreaking havoc on aquatic systems.",
            "Once plastics (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) enter the marine ecosystem, they persist for hundreds to thousands of years, breaking down through mechanical or photochemical processes into microplastics (particles less than 5mm) or nanoplastics (particles less than 1 µm) (Merlin and Balasubramanian, 2021), requiring meticulous research to effectively remove them from the surroundings, as their tiny size and lack of uniformity make it particularly challenging to extract them from polluted areas (Leng et al., 2018)."

        title: "Harmful Effects of Microplastics",
        content: ["Microplastics cause various harmful effects on both human health and the environment. Microplastics have been identified across several sequential stages in a food chain starting from lower levels like zooplankton and copepods to higher levels like fish, seabirds and mammals (Cverenkárová et al., 2021). Ingestion of microplastics by these organisms through the food web cascade can cause inflammation, physical blockages, and decreased feeding capacity. Other common sources of microplastics in the food chain include soil poisoning due to irrigation using wastewater, landfills, treatment of soil and usage of sewage sludge as fertilizers. This leads to decreased soil quality, consequently entering the food chain (Czapska et al., 2022). The ingestion of contaminated food or water, inhalation and dermal can be en route sources of microplastics in humans. As they enter the human body, they may tend to cause oxidative stress, deplete energy balance, and disturb normal metabolism and the immune system which can lead to respiratory and gastrointestinal problems (Jenner et al., 2022).", "Microplastics are common in both aquatic and earthbound systems. These are found in deep seas, oceans, soil and household systems. The sources of microplastics from households include food containers, fabrics and other plastic products (Geueke et al., 2018). Studies have found an enormous amount of microplastic contagion in tap and bottled water, tea, wine, beer, soft drinks and various food items that include fish, spices and other products from terrestrial animals (Kosuth et al., 2018)."]

When exposed to UV light, this hydrogel can be utilized to break down microplastics and enable reuse.", "A bio-based thermoplastic polyurethane was developed as an alternative to conventional plastics by researchers at the University of California San Diego, which can decompose within seven months even at the microplastic level to reduce the impact on the environment and health.", "There are ongoing studies that are focused on utilizing microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and algae to degrade microplastics and produce less harmful byproducts.", "Nanotechnology can solve microplastic degradation challenges. Functionalized carbon nano springs, for example, have demonstrated increased catalytic performance and stability, resulting in a considerable reduction in the activation energy for microplastic removal. Photocatalytic systems employing zinc oxide nanorods and zinc-cadmium photocatalysts have also shown an effective breakdown of microplastics under visible light (Jino, 2024)."]

Our project introduces a novel, eco-friendly solution utilizing affinity tag peptides immobilized on resins to capture and remove microplastics efficiently. The novelty of our proposed solution lies in synthesizing peptides with specific affinity tags that have a high binding affinity for various types of microplastics (e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene). This targeted binding ensures effective agglomeration of microplastic particles compared to other existing methods. The peptides can be tailored for optimal interaction with different microplastic types, enhancing the versatility and efficiency of the method (Woo et al., 2022).", "Our eco-friendly approach uses biologically derived peptides and benign resins, minimizing environmental harm compared to traditional chemical methods. The simplicity of peptide synthesis and resin immobilization allows for easy scalability, making this method ideal for large-scale deployment in diverse water treatment scenarios, balancing sustainability and efficiency.", "Our goal is to engineer E. coli to synthesize peptides capable of removing microplastics from the contaminated area. By targeting specific types of microplastics such as polystyrene, polypropylene, polyethylene, polycarbonate, and polyethylene terephthalate, we ensure efficient capture of these particles. The peptides and associated microplastics are then separated using a resin complex. This method not only enhances the speed and ease of isolation but also reduces sample contamination and minimizes the use of harsh chemicals. Moreover, this innovative approach offers scalability and adaptability, providing a versatile tool for addressing microplastic pollution in various conditions."],

To address this, we use a resin complex that binds to residues with high affinity His tags located at one end of the peptide sequence. Once these His-tagged peptides are produced, the Ni-NTA resin is introduced, forming a resin-peptide complex. This complex is then applied to the contaminated area where microplastics need to be removed, resulting in a resin-peptide-microplastic complex. The resin, along with the bound microplastics, is subsequently removed through filtration or centrifugation, effectively eliminating the microplastics from the system."]

However, non-agricultural soils have also been shown to contain microplastics, such as floodplain soils, soils on industrial sites, and soils in home gardens (Möller et al., 2021).

Although PET, PA and PAN garments release fibers during domestic washing (Sait et al., 2021). The hydrophobic peptide immobilized on the resin helps to capture the fiber particles on treatment (Woo et al., 2022) and the resins can be filtered out after use."
